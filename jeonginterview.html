<br><br><br><h1> A Transparent Career Interview with David Jeong</h1> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<article>
<div class="answer" id="2">
<p><br><br><br><br><br>Jeong: [00:00:00] Yeah. So I saw when I was in college, <span class="filler">uh,</span> I was a mechanical engineer or not a mechanical engineer, but I was like thinking of studying mechanical engineering.<span class="filler"> um,</span> when I went in, <span class="filler">um,</span> some thoughts about like physics or stuff like that.<span class="filler"> um,</span> yeah, but I think that just at one point I just realized I like using machines to make stuff and whatnot.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Like</span> it was not, not very exciting to me. <span class="filler">uh,</span> it just, I don't know, didn't give me like the control,<span class="filler"> um,</span> that I needed. Like, I don't know if you've ever worked with like, like very non-digital art or things like that, but <span class="filler">like,</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> yeah, it's pretty brutal because like the real world, there's so many actual other <span id="one">[00:01:00] </span> factors.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> so when you do <span class="filler">like</span> calculations and <span class="filler">like</span> predictions,<span class="filler"> um,</span> it's not like digitized things where <span class="filler">like,</span> if you did the calculation correct that should be good.<span class="filler"> um,</span> with mechanical engineering it was <span class="filler">like,</span> you did the calculations and it would still break.<span class="filler"> um,</span> because you actually need to learn about <span class="filler">like</span>- you actually need to take <span class="filler">like</span> 18 more courses to learn what's actually going on.<span class="filler"> um,</span> because <span class="filler">like</span> there's little particles in the air or whatnot.<span class="filler"> um,</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> so I don't know. I just <span class="filler">like,</span> didn't like the fact that it was like pretty inconsistent and it was also,<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> waiting in line to use things. Yeah. That was pretty brutal.<span class="filler"> um,</span> but anyways, <span class="filler">like,</span> CS was one of the required courses.</p>

<span class="filler">Um,</span> yeah, thankfully I just had to take it, so I was taking it and then I just had an idea <span class="filler">like,</span> <span id="tw0">[00:02:00]</span> oh, maybe this is something <span class="filler">like</span> I could do.<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> admittedly, it was never , oh yeah, <span class="filler">like</span> this is it. You know, <span class="filler">like,</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> it was just <span class="filler">like</span> something that I could do. So I decided to <span class="filler">like</span> pivot and change into that direction.

 the workload,<span class="filler"> um,</span> workload or rather like the number of courses you have to take was not a lot to switch,<span class="filler"> um,</span> for CS.<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> so I just <span class="filler">like</span> decided to do that. And then by the time I was <span class="filler">like</span> entering <span class="filler">like</span> my late junior, senior year.<span class="filler"> um,</span> yeah, I had no idea what I was doing, but I think,<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> I was applying to like internships and stuff.</p>
<p>But I was relatively <span class="filler">like,</span> so much less knowledgeable than some of my peers were. <span class="filler">Like,</span> I didn't know, <span class="filler">like</span> what area of <span id="three">[00:03:00]</span> specialization I wanted to go into. I actually didn't even know what those areas really meant.<span class="filler"> um,</span> whether it was <span class="filler">like,</span> yeah. Backend or database or, yeah.<span class="filler"> um,</span> so I applied to ESPN. <span class="filler">uh,</span> my cousin told me to apply and I was applying for the Android internship, I think.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> but they were like, oh, <span class="filler">like</span> we have <span class="filler">like</span> a spot open the iOS team. Would you be interested in <span class="filler">like</span> trying to do that?<span class="filler"> um,</span> I somehow got in.<span class="filler"> um,</span> I talked to my boss, I'm very close to, to the boss that hired me to this.<span class="filler"> um,</span> I talked to them about it and it was, <span class="filler">like,</span> I just told him, <span class="filler">like,</span> "I don't know how you accepted me" because <span class="filler">like,</span> I remember that interview and <span class="filler">like</span> the things we talked about and I'm like, I wouldn't accept me.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> so it took a big shot. <span id="four">[00:04:00]</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> so I went there and they were like, for the first several weeks, they were like, "Hey, just learn things on your own. And then <span class="filler">like</span> take online lessons on iOS and stuff."<span class="filler"> Um,</span> so I was like,<span class="filler"> um,</span> so I took <span class="filler">like</span> three weeks to do it, <span class="filler">like</span> tutorials at work, and then it just kind of started from there.
<span class="filler">Um,</span> but, <span class="filler">uh,</span> yeah, from that point on, you know, in terms of <span class="filler">like</span> skill wise and knowledge and just natural growth from doing the work.<span class="filler"> um,</span> but career wise, I made some active decisions. <span class="filler">Like,</span> I really wanted- I think I said this during the panel- <span class="filler">like,</span> I wanted to ensure that I <span class="filler">like</span> test out <span class="filler">like</span> different environments and companies before figuring out what I like.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> I wanted to, <span class="filler">like,</span> I wanted to know myself better in a way that <span class="filler">like,</span> every <span id="five">[00:05:00]</span> time I pick the next job, <span class="filler">uh,</span> or at least <span class="filler">like</span> after, into my initial trial,<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> my first three companies or so, after that, I would just hone it down more and more. So,<span class="filler"> um,</span> so actually with this job that I currently have, so I came from Lyft right before this.
Right.<span class="filler"> um,</span> and I'm currently working at a company called RO. <span class="filler">Uh,</span> I felt like I was really confident in what I wanted to be. So going from Lyft, RO I only applied to row and I told RO that I was only applying to them and it was either staying at Lyft or just going to RO. So,<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> I wasn't really <span class="filler">like</span> shopping around that much anymore.</p><br><br><br>

    <h3> Patel: So can you walk me through a bit of your career and how you got there?</h3>

<article>
<div class="answer" id="4">
<p><br><br><br><br>Jeong: I think I did. You know,<span class="filler"> um,</span> it is exactlyâ€” not exactly, but it is, you know, very, <span id="six">[00:06:00]</span> very close to <span class="filler">like</span> what I had anticipated.<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> I can't see myself, <span class="filler">like</span> trying to just apply for companies that I <span class="filler">like</span> don't know things about. <span class="filler">Like,</span> it's really hard for me to imagine now that I would <span class="filler">like</span> go into a company where I had never heard or, or even <span class="filler">like</span> a big company where I <span class="filler">like</span> don't even have <span class="filler">like</span> people there who can tell me about what's going on, <span class="filler">like</span> what it's like being there.
<span class="filler">Um,</span> I just don't see myself <span class="filler">like</span> doing that anymore. </p> <br><br><br>
</div>

<div class="question" id="3">
<p><h3>Patel: Are you satisfied with <span class="filler">like</span>... do you think you were able to hone in more?</h3></p>
</div>
</article>


<article>
<div class="answer" id="6">
<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jeong: Yeah. I think especially if they were <span class="filler">like</span> concerned, with stuff along the lines of <span class="filler">like</span>, truly, <span class="filler">like,</span> can you shape <span class="filler">like</span> the decision-making,<span class="filler"> um,</span> whether it's ethically or if it's just culturally, <span id="eight">[00:08:00]</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> yeah, I'm inclined to say <span class="filler">like,</span> probably those big companies are maybe not the place.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> <span class="filler">like,</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> by going to Lyft, I wanted, <span class="filler">like,</span> I just gave myself a shot to try it.<span class="filler"> um,</span> but out of the three companies that I wanted to experiment with going in, I had already known I had the highest odds of failure- failure in the sense that <span class="filler">like,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> not, not in the sense of, <span class="filler">like,</span> I wouldn't <span class="filler">like</span> learn technical things or <span class="filler">like</span> whatnot, but in terms of <span class="filler">like</span> how happy I was,<span class="filler"> um,</span> what I'm doing, how the company approaches their business and <span class="filler">like</span> their interactions with the workers.</p>
<p>Yeah. I was <span class="filler">like</span> there one year- I actually didn't last a year. I actually only lasted 11 months, but,<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span id="nine">[00:09:00]</span> yeah, my time I left, I was <span class="filler">like,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> I was pretty bad. I'm actually an extremely, extremely positive person.<span class="filler"> Um,</span> but I for the first time in my life, I felt <span class="filler">like</span> a consistent state of being down for a little while.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> so <span class="filler">like</span> at smaller companies,<span class="filler"> um,</span> you just get to influence more on <span class="filler">like</span> little decision-makings. You can be more involved in <span class="filler">like</span> the bigger process.<span class="filler"> um,</span> but at bigger companies a lot of that is stripped away from you.<span class="filler"> um,</span> and <span class="filler">like</span> to be just blunt about things <span class="filler">like,</span> you know, a lot of people are there at big companies because <span id="ten">[00:10:00] </span></p><br><br>
</div>

<div class="question" id="5">
<p> <h3>Patel: That's cool. Yeah. A lot of my friends who are in CS here, they say how, <span class="filler">like</span> how <span class="filler">like</span> the skills they learn are basically, I mean, they don't know anything <span class="filler">like</span> for their jobs, you know, everyone kind of has to learn on, on site, which is something that I'm aware of too.</p>
<span class="filler">Um,</span> that's cool though, that you were able to kind of go from place to place and hone in on that. And I guess, <span class="filler">like</span> one of the <span id="seven">[00:07:00]</span> questions I mentioned in the email that I was really curious about is I focus a lot on <span class="filler">like</span> ethics. I'm taking a class called Ethics of the Internet. And <span class="filler">like</span>, even though, you know, these companies like Google, like Spotify, Apple, they have <span class="filler">like</span> such bright and shiny names and <span class="filler">like</span>, I want to work there,<span class="filler"> um,</span> and have an impact.
But then there's also this whole side of<span class="filler">like</span>, what are these companies doing to people? And also <span class="filler">like</span>, just how fair is it of me to work there? There's <span class="filler">like</span> a lot of factors to just consider and, you know, I feel like there's probably a lot of feelings that come with it as well. You know, when you do work at a really good company, so yeah.
I was just wondering what your experience has been with that and <span class="filler">like</span>, yeah. </h3>

<div class="answer" id="8">
<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jeong: Yeah, big companies because,<span class="filler"> um,</span> yeah, to be blunt, <span class="filler">like</span> people chase the name, obviously. <span class="filler">uh,</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> but honestly, <span class="filler">like</span> that's really about it. <span class="filler">Like</span> a lot of <span class="filler">like</span> these <span class="filler">like</span> medium-sized companies that are <span class="filler">like</span> on the come up, they
oftentimes offer very comparably in terms of <span class="filler">like</span> compensation,<span class="filler"> um,</span> with these bigger companies. But like a lot of <span class="filler">like</span> these top talents still opt not to go because I don't know, <span class="filler">like</span> they just want to be there, I guess. </p> </div>

<div class="question" id="7">
    <p><h3>Patel: You froze for a second. </p> </h3>
  <h3>  <p>So people are at big companies because... and then I didn't hear anything.</p></h3>

<div class="answer" id="8">
<p><br><br><br><br><br>
<span class="filler">Um,</span> yeah.<span class="filler"> um,</span> so that, that's really interesting to me. <span class="filler">uh,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> I can't even, <span id="eleven">[00:11:00]</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> I can't even imagine what they're thinking about day-to-day <span class="filler">like</span> in regards to their job, because it's... so it, okay. Here. Here's what I think. <span class="filler">Like,</span> I can't even imagine what some of my friends are going through because they seem to be more attached to their jobs than I am. I'm talking about <span class="filler">like</span> the ones that are at bigger companies, <span class="filler">like</span> they identify much more with their roles and their jobs,<span class="filler"> um,</span> they identify much more with their company.<span class="filler"> um,</span> but at the same time, I wonder how that's possible because the company is so big and the business, and like, like you said, <span class="filler">like</span> the ethical decisions, the cultural decisions are so far removed from them. It's crazy to me that <span class="filler">like</span> they associate so heavily<span class="filler"> um,</span> </p></div>


<div class="question" id="7">
<h3><p>Patel: Yeah.
I mean, I guess that's the whole point of working there, <span id="twelve">[00:12:00]</span> right? It's <span class="filler">like,</span> so you can say "Oh I work here" and make that your personality. </p></h3>

<article>
<div class="answer" id="10">
<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jeong: it's not worth it. I'm going to be, I'm going to be a little bit more up front than I was on the panel. Yeah, I, yeah, I threw it away <span class="filler">like</span> so long ago.<span class="filler"> um,</span> it's <span class="filler">like,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> <span id="thirteen">[00:13:00]</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> honestly, <span class="filler">like</span> my parents have <span class="filler">like</span> accepted it because I've been doing it for so long now. She knows,<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> for me, <span class="filler">like</span> the whole status thing is <span class="filler">like</span> so broken and <span class="filler">like</span> so detrimental to one's, <span class="filler">uh,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> let's not even think about just, <span class="filler">like,</span> you know <span class="filler">like</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> ethics as <span class="filler">like</span> a,<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> a society based thing, but just even for myself,<span class="filler"> um,</span> It's <span class="filler">like</span> so bad, <span class="filler">like</span> so unhealthy to <span class="filler">like</span> tie myself to <span class="filler">like</span> statuses or numbers.
<span class="filler">Um,</span> so, <span class="filler">uh,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> I don't, so for me, <span class="filler">like,</span> I really dislike talking about, I guess, ironic that we're having this conversation but in <span id="fourteen">[00:14:00]</span> general settings, I <span class="filler">uh,</span> I really don't like talking about my job. <span class="filler">uh,</span><span class="filler"> um,</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> my sister and my mom complain, because I actually don't own <span class="filler">like</span> a single Harvard gear.</p>
<p>Actually, this is the current one that I have. It's is the only thing, but it's <span class="filler">like</span> a sports team jersey that I played on. So,<span class="filler"> um,</span> yeah. And so <span class="filler">like</span> I have this rule, <span class="filler">like</span> when I meet new people,<span class="filler"> um,</span> when I meet new people,<span class="filler"> um,</span> I never asked or mentioned about job, school or age, because I feel like those, I feel like they're the biggest bias, <span class="filler">uh,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> they drive like the biggest biases in, in <span class="filler">like</span> new meetings.</p>
<p>So I try to <span class="filler">like,</span> hold those off for a long, long time, if possible, as long as they don't bring it up. <span id="fifteen">[00:15:00]</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> and also just <span class="filler">like</span> in college, this might be a little extreme, but,<span class="filler"> um,</span> yeah, I, I, I didn't look at my grades in college.<span class="filler"> um,</span> so I think halfway through the first semester in college, I was already like developing this idea that, that like the grades are not very good ways to define myself.</p>
<p>Or <span class="filler">like</span> my GPA.<span class="filler"> um,</span> and I've been like getting the confirmation from all these adults,<span class="filler"> um,</span> people who <span class="filler">like</span> recently graduated who are like yeah, "<span class="filler">like</span> once you get to the real world, <span class="filler">like,</span> no one even cares. You'll never even remember. Well, you might be the only person who remembers."<span class="filler"> um,</span> and <span class="filler">like</span> I was taking that to heart.</p>
<p>I personally find it like very <span id="sixteen">[00:16:00]</span> important to, I try to weigh <span class="filler">like</span> others people's experiences <span class="filler">like</span> as importantly as mine.<span class="filler"> Um,</span> it's normal human behavior to <span class="filler">like</span> weigh your own experience much more heavily. But I try <span class="filler">like,</span> not do that as much. <span class="filler">Like</span> if other people consistently feel that way, then <span class="filler">like</span> there's a lot of value with that.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> more value than <span class="filler">like</span> how I instinctively feel about it. So,<span class="filler"> um,</span> so I try to listen to that. And then eventually what I decided was that,<span class="filler"> um,</span> I'll just never looked at a single grade.<span class="filler"> um,</span> so <span class="filler">like</span> whether it was tests or homework GPA, <span class="filler">like</span> I graduated without knowing,<span class="filler"> um,</span> I never looked at it and didn't put it on my resume.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> And honestly, that was <span class="filler">like</span> a very, very, very big shifting point for me in terms of like academic and professional career. <span id="seventeen">[00:17:00]</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like,</span> yeah, <span class="filler">like,</span> I, it was so much easier for me to <span class="filler">like</span> put things down too, for more important things.<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> once I started dissociating from the numbers, it was like, oh, "My friend needs help with something" <span class="filler">like</span> something <span class="filler">like,</span> oh, <span class="filler">like</span> a medium sized problem.</p>
<p><span class="filler">uh,</span> and <span class="filler">like</span> I have homework to do.<span class="filler"> um,</span> but I was never going to see the numbers for my homework anyways. So in college it was so much easier for me to be like, oh yeah, "I'll just <span class="filler">like,</span> not do <span class="filler">like</span> the last two problems of my homework and go help my friend, which, you know, <span class="filler">like</span> if you ask, everyone knows that <span class="filler">like,</span> oh yeah <span class="filler">like</span> helping your friend is more important than <span class="filler">like</span> the two problems on your homework. But when you're in the thick of things as a college student, it's not so, <span class="filler">uh,</span> simple to make that decision probably. Yeah, <span id="eighteen">[00:18:00]</span> </p><br><br><br>
</div>

<div class="question" id="9">
<p><h3>Patel: Cool. Well, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. <span class="filler">It's like,</span> I can see both sides, you know, I can see what your friends, you know, well <span class="filler">like</span> even for me, you know, my parents are immigrants. <span class="filler">Like</span> their friends talk about how their kids are going to <span class="filler">like</span> Microsoft and I'm sitting there like, oh, I want to make my parents proud and go to a big name company. But on the other hand, I'm like, what value is that bringing besides just <span class="filler">like</span> clout? </h3></p>

So the first question, <span class="filler">uh,</span> sorry, what was the first one?
Oh yeah, what do I tie myself to?<span class="filler"> um,</span> yeah, the two questions are a little connected for me.<span class="filler"> um,</span> for me, my biggest value that I just feel something that drives me <span class="filler">like</span> very innately is having a positive impact primarily on the people around me.<span class="filler"> um,</span> yeah. For the bigger community, yes, but,<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span id="twenty">[00:20:00]</span> <span class="filler">like,</span> you know, I, I care and <span class="filler">like</span> take, take part, <span class="filler">uh,</span> but <span class="filler">like</span>, you know, just <span class="filler">like</span> being very honest with myself, <span class="filler">like</span> people that I can see and people I interact with,<span class="filler"> um,</span> for me, I really love spending,<span class="filler"> um,</span> whether it's the time or the money or,<span class="filler"> um,</span> just like the emotional space.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> you know, I think <span class="filler">like</span> I was very lucky to be born with kind of <span class="filler">like</span> a positivity, <span class="filler">like</span> an affinity towards like positivity. So I always feel, I always felt like I had more emotional space,<span class="filler"> um,</span> than <span class="filler">like</span> some other people around me. And,<span class="filler"> um,</span> and <span class="filler">like</span>, if they needed to <span class="filler">like</span> take some load onto me, <span class="filler">like</span> that was <span class="filler">like</span> okay with me.<span id="twenty1">[00:21:00]</span> 
<span class="filler">Um,</span> and for me, that's like always the biggest driver of how I'm doing <span class="filler">like</span>.</p>
<p>When I am trying to <span class="filler">like,</span> help someone <span class="filler">like</span> get a job or I'm trying to, <span class="filler">like,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> when other people need to, <span class="filler">like,</span> I don't know, something simple as <span class="filler">like</span> they need to <span class="filler">like</span> move in and <span class="filler">like</span> move boxes or stuff, or they need to just <span class="filler">like,</span> talk about some things, <span class="filler">uh,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> how available can I be? How, <span class="filler">like,</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> how engaged can I be?</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> so that's <span class="filler">like</span> kind of like the external way I evaluate myself. And more internally,<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> I always say <span class="filler">like,</span> my dream is just <span class="filler">like,</span> to just do my hobbies. And <span id="twenty2">[00:22:00]</span> I don't know if this is gonna make any sense. It might feel a little  meta, but <span class="filler">like</span> my dream is to always do my hobby. But I only have one hobby which is having hobbies. But,<span class="filler"> um,</span> yeah, so I was just making a point that <span class="filler">like,</span> I wasn't like fixated or like invested on <span class="filler">like,</span> just one thing.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Like</span> I just define hobby as <span class="filler">like</span> something that makes me happier at a certain time when I'm doing it. Right.<span class="filler"> um, so.</span>  You know, I try not to fall into the idea of <span class="filler">like</span> oh, <span class="filler">like</span> I invested in this, therefore, <span class="filler">like</span> it means something. No, for me,<span class="filler">it's just like, I,</span> it means something when it means something. It doesn't have to be <span class="filler">like</span> so deep. So <span class="filler">like</span> for me, <span class="filler">like,</span> I will invest <span class="filler">like,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> six months a year into <span class="filler">like</span> trying to get better or <span class="filler">like,</span> whatever.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> and then one <span id="twenty3">[00:23:00]</span> morning I can wake up and not feel the same way. And then, that's fine. <span class="filler">Like,</span> let's just drop it. Do something else.<span class="filler"> um,</span> so that's kind of <span class="filler">like</span> internally how I evaluate my self-worth in terms of <span class="filler">like</span> <span class="filler">like</span> how much am I enjoying what I'm doing day to day,<span class="filler"> um,</span> which is surprisingly hard to execute also because it's like sometimes I do find myself doing things that I'm like ugh, <span class="filler">like</span> I'm sick of doing it, or <span class="filler">like,</span> I'm like, ugh. <span class="filler">uh,</span> because like enforcing change in your life is a little hard. So even with <span class="filler">like</span> things as like hobbies, it might be as silly as <span class="filler">like</span> playing video games, playing a certain sport. If you just do the same thing for awhile, you just like habitually go back to those things and you might not even enjoy it that much anymore.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> so. Very non career driven things. I think people end up doing the same, like with their job, <span class="filler">like,</span> <span id="twenty4">[00:24:00]</span> they just can't quit just because they've been there for so long.<span class="filler"> um,</span> so I try to <span class="filler">like</span> self-check myself and kind of ask. <span class="filler">Like,</span> I might be playing a video game and I'm like, wait, I have to ask myself, stop for a second and be like, am I having fun playing this video game?</p>
<p><span class="filler">uh,</span> if not, <span class="filler">like</span> I should just turn it off and play something else or I don't know. I'm just kind of <span class="filler">like</span> always keeping myself in check.<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> and then to answer your second question,<span class="filler"> um,</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> goes back to my external evaluation of myself having a positive impact. <span class="filler">uh,</span> I used to be a little bit more selfish, I think,<span class="filler"> um,</span> just until <span class="filler">like</span> maybe like four or five years ago.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> I was really starting to develop like the philosophies that I talked about.<span class="filler"> um,</span> for me, it was like earlier on, it was like, <span class="filler">like,</span> I was <span id="twenty5">[00:25:00]</span> confident that it's working for me.<span class="filler"> um,</span> and to this day I am confident that it's working for me and I feel good about them.<span class="filler"> um,</span> but I think I had a tendency to think that <span class="filler">like,</span> it's the same for others.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> or I was like playing this kind of <span class="filler">like</span> mindset of <span class="filler">like</span> <span class="filler">like</span> "they haven't seen it yet."<span class="filler"> Um,</span> So I was doing a thing where I was <span class="filler">like</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> like if other people were living life focused on something very different from me, I'm like, "that's just not the way." <span class="filler">Like</span> that's just the mindset I had.<span class="filler"> um,</span> but now I approach it very differently.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> I'm starting to, for <span class="filler">like</span> the last several years I've come to the realization that the only way I was able to kind of <span class="filler">like</span> get to this point and <span class="filler">like</span> my state of being was <span id="twenty6"> [00:26:00]</span> that, <span class="filler">like,</span> I just have to ask myself questions all the time on why I was doing things.<span class="filler"> Um,</span> <span class="filler">like,</span> do I really like it? Do I hate it?</p>
<p>Just questioning.<span class="filler"> Um,</span> and I realized like the conclusions that came after it didn't really matter too much.<span class="filler"> Um,</span> so when I talk to <span class="filler">like</span> my close friends that I care about, I wouldn't <span class="filler">like</span> enforce it on strangers, but <span class="filler">like</span> when I talked to my close friends and they're <span class="filler">like</span> struggling with something, or they <span class="filler">like</span> want to <span class="filler">like</span> change something or <span class="filler">like</span> whatever, for me, <span class="filler">like</span> I just gear it towards asking them <span class="filler">like</span> okay, <span class="filler">like,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> "why do you want to do it?"</p>
<p><span class="filler">Like,</span> are you actually <span class="filler">like,</span> feeling happy about it? <span class="filler">Like</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> I just want the people around me to just be more critical of <span class="filler">like</span> their own decisions and be <span class="filler">like</span><span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">like</span> really look inside on <span class="filler">like,</span> why something <span id="twenty7">[00:27:00]</span> is making you feel a certain way.<span class="filler"> Um,</span> because tons of my friends, <span class="filler">like</span> who are so <span class="filler">like</span> terrific, <span class="filler">like</span> after college are <span class="filler">like</span> slowly becoming <span class="filler">like</span> really burnt out or realizing that they don't have <span class="filler">like</span> a clear direction.</p>
<p><span class="filler">uh,</span> and I would just love to see my friends, <span class="filler">like</span> ask themselves <span class="filler">like</span> more frequently instead of just <span class="filler">like</span> being driven by <span class="filler">like</span> the path that's already paved or something.<span class="filler"> um,</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> that being said, I also come to the realization that when they asked those questions, people arrive at very different places sometimes from me.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Like</span> they might do the due diligence and still find that succeeding in their career, is something very important or <span class="filler">like</span> making a certain amount of money still is a very important thing to them after they've had <span class="filler">like</span> an honest conversation with themselves. And if that's the case, <span id="twenty8">[00:28:00]</span> <span class="filler">uh,</span> then tying that to me and wanting to have a positive impact, <span class="filler">uh,</span> I still think it makes sense for me to try to help other people get closer to what they find is important, given that I have the resources to help them reach, reach there. <span class="filler">Like,</span> even though I don't want to be where they, where they are trying to head towards.<span class="filler"> Um,</span> so yeah, <span class="filler">like</span> I'm just trying to, in the last, last several years, I'm trying to recognize that <span class="filler">like,</span> things that are not innately important to me are innately important to other people.</p>
<p><span class="filler">Um,</span> and.<span class="filler"> um,</span> if I find those people to be important, then I don't need to find those things important, but I need to understand that they are important,<span class="filler"> um,</span> in other, and therefore <span class="filler">like</span> indirectly important to me. </p>

<div class="question" id="11">
<h3><p>Patel: I'm relating to a lot of stuff you're saying.<span class="filler"> um,</span> I'm not as extreme as not checking my grades, but I also, <span class="filler">like</span> ever since first year, I've always been <span class="filler">like</span>, I don't know, like "it's not a big deal."
Like academics, it sounds weird, but it's <span class="filler">like</span> not my main priority at Yale. Yeah. </p></h3>
<p><h3>And much like you it's like, I take classes I like. Actually my friends kind of make fun of me because I guess, the reason I ended up with this major is because I'm really stubborn. I refuse to take classes I don't like.<span class="filler"> Um,</span> I looked <span class="filler">like</span> at all the major requirements and if it had a class that I didn't like, I just wouldn't major in that, which is, again, maybe a little extreme because a lot of people do make sacrifices.
<span class="filler">Um,</span> but then I was like, you know, I'm just gonna take whatever I want and then do whatever I want so it was really liberating. And I, and I really liked that.<span class="filler"> um,</span> but what you said brought up some questions, which is <span class="filler">like</span> two things.<span class="filler"> um,</span> one, so then what do you tie your <span id="nineteen">[00:19:00]</span> worth to? It's, <span class="filler">like,</span> you know, <span class="filler">like,</span> I guess what brings you value?
And then two, if you're <span class="filler">like</span> very, <span class="filler">like,</span> you know, anti career talk and <span class="filler">like</span> you don't think career should be a big deal,<span class="filler"> um,</span> I guess, <span class="filler">like,</span>, why do you do career consulting and <span class="filler">like,</span> why do you show up to these panels and <span class="filler">like</span> connect with people? </h3></p> </div>
